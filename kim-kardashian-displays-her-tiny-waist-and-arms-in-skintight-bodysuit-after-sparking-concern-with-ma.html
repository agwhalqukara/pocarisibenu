Then she got skinnier.</p><p>“Which is kind of sad because it’s his looks that are trailing in the relationship, not her.”</p><p>Another added: “You could be onto something. Also – as he is so skinny, maybe she’s trying to feel ‘smaller’ to match him physically.”</p><p>A third posted: “Pete’s been with skinny white women, she probably feels insecure about not being his typical type.”</p><img decoding=async alt="New detail about missing woman's relationship with ex after cops find body" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/kc-mary-excl-comp3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async alt="Judge's son's brutal final act before plunging naked 16 floors to his death" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MK-DOUG-SOLOMAN-DEATH-COMP.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Kim revealed on The TODAY Show in June that although she lost 21 pounds to fit into the iconic dress, she does not plan on losing any more.</p><p>“I’m not trying to lose any more weight, but I have more energy than ever.
