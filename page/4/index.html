The original Standard hotel, a beloved celebrity hotspot on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, has announced that it is closing today after 22 years in operation.
Opened by hotelier Andre Balazs in 1999, the hotel, its bar, and its restaurant became a favorite haunt for a host of stars including Jennifer Lopez, Uma Thurman, and Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the original investors.
However, celebrity support has dwindled in recent months amid strict restrictions put in place as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and coupled with an increase in rent, the hotel has been left unable to sustain itself, revealing in a statement that it is now ‘impossible’ to remain open.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Did CNN anchor Don Lemon Marry Boyfriend John Byrne?
