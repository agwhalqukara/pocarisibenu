Like the vows they took on their wedding, the lovebirds have been with each other through sickness and health, rich and poor. We hope to learn more details about their marriage in the coming days.</p><p>The married duo also formed the Daniel & Pamella DeVos Foundation in 1992 to support organizations and causes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dan_DeVos_Wife_Gave_Birth_To_Their_Three_Children></span>Dan DeVos’ Wife Gave Birth To Their Three Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After tying the knot, Mr. and Mrs. DeVos grew their family from two to five by welcoming <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>three wonderful children</a>.

Also, it might be easy to spot her in the crowd as she often dons dress pants and her signature crisp white shirt.</p><p>Not only that, but Mrs. DeVos thanks her family for where she is now. She comes from a family, who not only travels or indulges in arts but also works together. All in all, Dan DeVos’ wife must be earning significantly, given that she has received significantly immense positive responses.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Grew_Up_With_Two_Siblings></span>Grew Up With Two Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pamella DeVos was born<strong> Pamella VanderLaan</strong> to <strong>Charlotte Ann Vanderlaan</strong> and <strong>Dick Vanderlaan</strong> in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents raised her along with her sisters, <strong>Sheryl DeSanto</strong> and <strong>Brenda Thompson</strong>. Unfortunately, Pamella Roland’s parents have already passed away.</p><p>All in all, Dan DeVos’ wife seems to be doing great and living her best life.
