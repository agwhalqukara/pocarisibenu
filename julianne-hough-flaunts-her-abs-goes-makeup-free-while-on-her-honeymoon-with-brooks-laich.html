Brooks also shared a photo of his wife wearing that same bikini and he gushed over her in the caption.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: 'Dancing With the Stars' Judge Julianne Hough and Pro Dancer Peta Murgatroyd Got Married on the Same Day!</a></p><p>"That view though……we might never leave," the 34-year-old wrote. He also shared another photo he took of Jules wearing an adorable high-waisted blue bikini, and he sweetly referred to the 28-year-old as "Mrs. Laich" in the caption.</p><p>It looks like they're having a blast so much that Julianne doesn't want to be bothered with applying makeup! She shared a series of adorable selfies with her NHL star "huzzbin" as they enjoyed brunch together, and she absolutely glowed in the makeup-free photo.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Learn All About Julianne Hough's New Husband, Brooks Laich!</a></p><p>Julianne and Brooks said "I do" on Saturday, July 8 in front of about 200 guests during <a href=#>a romantic lakeside wedding ceremony</a> near her parent's home in Idaho.
