And this has also raised a wake-up call in the South Asia community.</p><p>Some also shared that the South Asian males could not digest that their wives had not only left them but could survive and be happy and do well without them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/7/2c5fd8e9-b2ff-4c84-a841-76d61584056b.webp><p>Other South Asian women also expressed that they have experienced the same stigmas and isolation when trying to leave abusive partners.</p><p>Just last month, Sania shared about how going through a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>divorce</a>&nbsp;as a South Asian woman sometimes feels like you failed at life. And that’s not all; the way the community labels you, the lack of support, and the pressure to stay with someone make you feel like you are a failure and wrong sometimes.</p><p>She even wrote that her family pressured her to maintain an intact relationship with her husband. And if she refused, sometimes they even retorted and threatened her with suicide.</p><p>In her TikTok video, we could see her happy and glow-up face after she split from her husband and led a single life. In one of her posts, she wrote that she has never been happier after living with his ex.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWWkpHq0rc2imGajmJa7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-between-meghan-markle-and-kate-middleton.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened Between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton?</span></a>
