<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Exploring Sofia Huertas Salary and Career What We Know About Sofia Huertas Boyfriend?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The U.S. Women’s soccer team is gaining steam ahead of the 2023 summer World Cup. Recently they triumphed in the SheBelives Cup, and one person who was a part of the victorious moment was defender <strong>Sofia Huerta.</strong></p><p>Huerta was one of the best National Women’s Soccer League defenders 2022 season and is one of the players to make her cut as one of the World Cup rosters. Here’s everything we know about Sofia Huerta’s salary, career, and boyfriend.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Holds_Dual_Citizenship></span>Holds Dual Citizenship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia was born on December 14, 1992, in Boise, Idaho. She comes from a mixed race. Her father, <strong>Mauricio Huerta</strong>, is a native of Puebla, Mexico, and also an electrical engineer. Her mother is <strong>Jody Jensen Huerta</strong>, who is an American citizen. Hence, Huerta held dual citizenship in Mexico and the United States.</p><p>The USWNT athlete began her journey in the lower divisions of the Mexican National Team. Due to her father’s Mexican roots, Sofia could play with El Tri Femenil. She played Under-20 World Cup against Brazil from Mexico.</p><p>Sofia was praised for her quality play, but deep down, her ultimate dream was to be part of the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT), which she eventually achieved. She is among two women who have played <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">for and against</a> the U.S. and Mexican women’s soccer teams. The other one is <strong>Veronica Zepeda</strong>.</p><p></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Huertas_Club_Career></span>Huerta’s Club Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia started her club journey with the Chicago Red Stars of the National Women’s Soccer League. She was the eleventh player to be selected overall. Huerta scored her first two professional goals against the Boston Breakers, leading Chicago Red Stars to the top of the NWSL league.</p><p>Since Huerta showed her exceptional athleticism, she was named NWSL Player of the week for week five. However, on June 18, 2018, Sofia was traded to Houston Dash. The trade was requested by Sofia in the hopes of getting more playing time.</p><p>In Houston Dash, Sofia appeared in a total of 12 games and scored 5 goals. Later, on September 28, 2018, it was announced that Sofia Huerta would join Sydney FC in the W-League for the 2018-19 season. The Idaho native helped Sydney win 4-2 against Perth in the grand final of the 2018-19 W-League Championship.</p><p>On February 3, 2020, Huerta joined OL Reign in exchange for <strong>Shea Groom</strong> and <strong>Megan Oyster</strong>. She has been playing as a right back for OL Reign.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=International_Career></span>International Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Huerta had no luck playing international league for several years, even after being affiliated with the United States Women’s National Soccer Team (USWNT). Hence, she sought other clubs’ opportunities to play outside to return to the roster.</p><p>Finally, in 2022, Sofia was called to play in the 2022 CONCACAF Women’s Championship qualifiers. The United States emerged as the winner defeating Canada 1-0 in the final.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sofia-Huerta-Career-1.jpg><p>Huerta is one of the treasured and talented women’s national team members and is only bound to do great in her career. We look forward to seeing her shine in the FIFA Women’s World Cup this year. Another player who made her cut in the FIFA world cup 2023 is <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Alyssa Naeher</a></strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Dating_Anyone></span>Is Dating Anyone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sofia isn’t much of a giver. Her social media will let you on in her professional life but rarely gives a glimpse into her personal life. The USWNT athlete prefers to keep it low profile regarding her privacy. Many fans are curious about Sofia Huerta’s boyfriend, but unfortunately, Sofia has kept her dating life very personal.</p><p>Presumably, Sofia is currently single. But according to some sources, Huerta was in a relationship with <strong>Matt Marzahl</strong> a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">few years</a> ago. The reason for their breakup wasn’t revealed, but both Huerta and Marzahl have moved on with their lives.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sofias_Income_From_Soccer></span>Sofia’s Income From Soccer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The athletes are less likely to share their salary, and there aren’t any other verified resources to verify the player’s income. Hence, there isn’t any information regarding Sofia Huerta’s salary as a national team player.</p><p>However, from the looks of Sofia’s Instagram, we can conclude that the defender earns a notable amount and lives a comfortable life. The national team players are also sponsored for various brand deals adding to their respective income. All in all, Huerta earns enough to lead a comfortable life, and we send her good wishes for her bright future.</p><p><strong>For<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror.</span></strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcL%2FOn6CaZZiqsrPAwGaZqLGWp7amusNmqpqkkafGbq%2FAq5yeql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-willis-net-worth-2024-children-how-old-is-emma-willis-age.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Willis Net Worth 2024, Children, How Old Is Emma Willis Age?</span></a>
