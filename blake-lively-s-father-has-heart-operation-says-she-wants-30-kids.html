"I moved to Utah because of the snow, but I haven't been able to ski. I literally didn’t have the heart to do it. Now, I’m excited about living the rest of my life instead of sitting around.”</p><p>"I have three rambunctious grandchildren in Utah and three more in California who are a lot of fun and keep me busy. And I think I’ll have more," the patriarch of the Lively family added, hinting at Blake, 26, and son-in-law <strong><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a></strong>' future family.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"My youngest daughter is newly married and wants a big family.
