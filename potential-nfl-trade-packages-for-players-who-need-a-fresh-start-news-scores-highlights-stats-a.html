Tennessee Titans receive: 2025 sixth-round pick
There's an argument to be made that Treylon Burks is already getting a fresh start. With Brian Callahan taking over as head coach in Tennessee, the 2022 first-round pick will play in a new offense with Will Levis as the starter from opening week.
DeAndre Hopkins even went to bat for his teammate, writing in a since-deleted X post that the media is the only entity doubting the receiver."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But there's no denying that Burks is a clear fourth option on the roster. They not only signed Calvin Ridley but also added Tyler Boyd, who brings a lot of experience with Callahan to the table.</p><p>Even if Burks is much better than he was last season, it will be hard for him to carve out a role in the new Titans offense. Last season he had just 16 receptions for 221 yards in 11 games.</p><p>A move to another team, like the New York Giants, which is still trying to figure out the receiving corps, would make sense. Going from Levis to Daniel Jones might be a downgrade, but the Giants have a lot of unknowns at wide receiver right now.</p><p>Rookie Malik Nabers figures to be their No. 1 receiver. Darius Slayton would be the No. 2 option, but he's currently sitting out OTAs while he works on a new contract with the G-Men.</p><p>There are many young options the Giants hope will hit big this season. Adding Burks would give them another body type with potential in the room. At 6'2", 225 pounds, the former Razorback is much bigger than the likes of Wan'Dale Robinson (5'8", 185) and Jalin Hyatt (6'0", 185).</p><p>Burks would still have to fight for reps and targets, but the competition would be a lot lighter in New York.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmd%2Fen6MqaatnZ6ptqK4jKedpWWkp66lsYypmJyjkZyytHnFqKlmqJyWxqa%2B0mauoaddo7KmsIyaZJ%2Bqlai1br%2FTmqmt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordin-sparks-gets-sexy-in-new-instagram-themed-double-tap-video.html><span>←</span><span>Jordin Sparks Gets Sexy in New Instagram-Themed &amp;quot;Double Tap&amp;quot; Video</span></a>
