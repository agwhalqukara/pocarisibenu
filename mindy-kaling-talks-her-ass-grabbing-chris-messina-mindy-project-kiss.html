<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Mindy Kaling Talks Her &amp;quot;Ass-Grabbing&amp;quot; Chris Messina Mindy Project Kiss</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>On Tuesday night, The Mindy Project dropped a major bombshell for its winter finale episode, “Desert.” <strong>[WARNING: Major spoilers ahead.]</strong> After two seasons of building up sexual tension between Mindy Lahiri (star and creator <strong><a href=#>Mindy Kaling</a></strong>) and Danny Castellano (<strong>Chris Messina</strong>), the show finally delivered a raunchy makeout session between the two, during a flight from Los Angeles to New York.&nbsp;</p><p>Mindy Kaling spoke with Us Weekly about the episode and that “ass-grabbing” kiss at the Elle Women in Television event on Jan. 22.</p><p>Kaling, 34, argued to Us that Mindy and Danny’s onscreen lip-lock was much more passionate than another very famous sitcom smooch.</p><p>“I was in The Office when Jim and Pam kissed, and that was a very chaste, romantic kiss,” she told Us. “And this was, like there was sexual tension building up, and this was it exploding. I thought while the episode had romantic parts to it, but I thought the kiss was actually more of like a makeout.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The former star of and writer for The Office continued to compare her character’s highly-anticipated hook up to the now-ended NBC comedy’s popular couple, Jim Halpert (<strong><a href=#>John Krasinski</a></strong>) and Pam Beesly (<strong><a href=#>Jenna Fischer</a></strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re much older than Jim and Pam were,” Kaling said of the Mindy Project leads. “It’s much more like an expression of that than it was like a romantic kiss.”</p><p>And though the makeout session was definitely a longtime coming, many fans are excited and slightly nervous about where the show will go after reaching such a satisfying climax.&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, the good thing about them is the kiss can go so many ways,” Kaling said. “Because it was more of like a frantic makeout, because it was more of an expression of lust than romance, those are the kind of things that people often regret. So I feel like that left it open in a lot of ways for us. But in the first episode back, it deals with it in such a funny way that I’m just excited for you guys to see it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And speaking of sexual tension, the Fox star recently had a swoon-worthy moment of her own in real life when she sat next to A-Lister<strong> <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a></strong> (his fiancee <strong><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a></strong> was a no-show) at the SAG Awards on Saturday, Jan. 18.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“For whatever reason, I was sitting next to Matt Damon and Brad Pitt,” she revealed. “I was like in the Ocean’s Eleven&nbsp;reunion section. I felt like people just thought I was like Brad Pitt’s publicist or something.”</p><p>And when Pitt’s sexy new hairdo blocked Kaling’s view of the stage, she didn’t ask him to move, but rather soaked it all in.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was staring at the back of that sexy hair cut he has,” she said. “So I was staring at the back of his long, beautiful neck. It was amazing. It was the best night of my life.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpqCnnKliuKK4yKeeZpmjqHqovsCbmaKml2K6qrrDsmSpqp%2BfsqTAjKSgrKtdmLWztdJmpJ6ro567onmRaWhtamNm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-xxxtentacion-anime-happening-xxxtentacion-anime-updated-news.html><span>←</span><span>Is XXXTentacion Anime Happening?
