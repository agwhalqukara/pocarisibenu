He goes, ‘It’s the same tempo. It’s going to work.’ He said, ‘Don’t come to rehearsal today. Let us get it right and then come down. We’ll do both of them and you decide.’ He was like, ‘It’s so inescapable that it should be ‘Golden Years’ that there’s no way you can disagree with me.’ He just laid it all out like a legal case.”</p><p>Choreographer <strong>Stuart Hopps </strong>also supported the change.</p><p>“At the time, I thought that the Bowie choice was a good one,” he wrote in an email, “and although the dance patterns remained much the same, the choice of music meant I could give the dance routine a more modern feel and get the actors to let go more and swing more.”</p><p><strong>Brian</strong> also just remembered <strong>Heath</strong>‘s spirit on the film set, saying that he “never saw someone like that. Everyone just fell in love with him — guys, girls, everybody. Just everyone loved him, and he loved you back.”</p><p>If you missed it, it was just revealed that <strong>Heath </strong><a href=#>almost starred in this musical film</a>!</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomV2gu6qzx62qZqyRobJusMirnJysn6d6s7HCmqOlq12dsqLAx2ajnpyXmr9ur8eapaChnpx6tbTEZqqoppdiwbB506GcZqGTpLuqr4ydmKeblWLApLHNnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stale-saying-crossword-clue-newsday.html><span>←</span><span>Stale saying Crossword Clue Newsday</span></a>
