She knows it’s a battle&nbsp;for her whole life.”</p><p>In November, Britney’s attorney, Samuel D. Ingham III, claimed in a court hearing that the “Toxic” singer&nbsp;<a href=#>had become “afraid”</a>&nbsp;of her father, Jamie Spears, and wanted him removed from her conservatorship. “She will not perform again if her father is in charge of her career,” he said.</p><p>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny declined to suspend Jamie, 68, from his duties, but stated that she was open to hear arguments for his removal in the future.
