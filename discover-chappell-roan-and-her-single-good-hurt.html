At just 19 years old, she is wise beyond her years and sings self-penned songs with utter conviction.</p><p>Chappell’s journey began at the age of 12 when she began taking piano lessons. Inspired by the sounds of Fleetwood Mac and Bob Dylan, she taught herself to play by ear. Over the years, her mum encouraged her to perform around her hometown, and soon enough a buzz surrounded the songstress, particularly as she started to share her music online. Atlantic Records caught wind of Chappell’s talent, and snapped her up before she even finished her junior year of high school.</p><p><span class=text_exposed_show>However, now is the time for Chappell to make her mark on the industry. She released her debut single, ‘Good Hurt’, in August and it has already garnered over 260,000 streams on Spotify. The dark pop song is both haunting and emotive, and showcases Chappell’s incredible vocal ability. Lyrically, the song is brutally honest and we’re sure that many people will not only feel every inch of emotion, but be able to resonate with the poignant lyrics.</span></p><p>Speaking about the track, she said: “It’s hard for me to explain what ‘Good Hurt’ is about. The best way for me to describe it is an addiction to pain. The meaning lies in the song and the video. Watch and listen and they will tell you everything.”</p><p>The music video, directed by Griffin Stoddard, brings the track to life in an unusual manner. Set in an alternative spa which resembles more of an asylum, Chappell is seen receiving terrifying treatments which evidently give her a ‘good hurt’ kind of feeling. It’s an interesting concept which gives a second meaning to the powerful track.</p><p class=p-text>Check out the video for ‘Good Hurt’ below’.</p><p></p><p><span class=text_exposed_show>In addition to capturing the hearts of music lovers across the world, Chappell also has a super fan in the form of Troye Sivan! The singer-songwriter and YouTuber took to Twitter to publicly show his support after the release of the music video. We couldn’t agree more with his statement – if Chappell is delivering such quality content for her debut, we can’t wait to see what her future releases will entail.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>IMAGINE this was your first ever song/music video.
