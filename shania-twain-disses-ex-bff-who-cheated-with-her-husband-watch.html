The singer revealed what she would say to Thiebaud if she ever ran into her during the show’s Plead the Fifth segment.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, Twain, 49, quipped: “I wish I’d never met you.”</p><p>Quick recap: Thiebaud had an affair with Twain’s husband and her chief musical producer <strong>Robert “Mutt” Lange</strong>, which ended their 17-year marriage in June 2010. (The exes share son Eja, now 13.) After that messy split, the “That Don’t Impress Me Much” singer found comfort in a familiar face — Thiebaud’s hubby<strong> Frederic Nicolas Thiebaud</strong>. After the couple swap, Twain wed Frederic in January 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Twain opened up about her broken marriage in <a href=#>Redbook magazine</a> back in May 2011, noting that she literally couldn’t speak after the betrayal.</p><p>“It was like I was kicked off my own bus while it was moving full speed ahead, and I landed in the dirt and everything I had was thrown out after me,” she said at the time. “And after tumbling and getting a mouthful of dirt, I had to try to stand up, then figure out where I was and start walking.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“When my marriage broke down, I got so physically constricted that I couldn’t get any volume out at all,” she added. “I couldn’t even call for my dog. I realize I couldn’t live without singing and had to do something about it. This is why I was like, ‘Just get it all out right now. Clean the pipes.'”</p><p>Twain — who just announced her final <a href=#>Rock This Country tour</a> — eventually recovered from the heartache, but admitted that it took eight months to do so. “Yes, I’m still me, and yes, I’m a mother, and yes, I’m a singer and a songwriter,” she said. “And I can love again, and I have friends, and yes, I’m alive.”</p><p>Watch the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqhmZ6erm7A1pqgp2WUnsC0sdJmnLFlkpuzbsPHqGScoJWWwaawjLCgraBdnbKzeceuqpuZnpl6uK3TnJ9mamBmgnJ%2Bkg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./remy-zaken-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Remy Zaken Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
