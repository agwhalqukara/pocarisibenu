The couple has been together for more than 25 years, but didn’t officially marry until 2017.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_educational_background_and_family>Early life, educational background and family</span></h2><p>Georges LeBar was born on 24 January 1973, in Perth, Western Australia, so holds Australian nationality. He spent his childhood in Australia, and his parents still live there. Georges is in good relationship with his mother, and she is also a big friend of Georges’ spouse, RuPaul. Since his childhood Georges has been interested in fine arts, and did a lot of painting – his parents supported his passions. He matriculated from his local Australian high school in 1991, and then, according to his <a rel=nofollow href=#>own words</a>, studied fashion and design in New York, Paris and Miami.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Georges LeBar is a painter; his works from 2006 to 2007 have been published in two books, “Six Inches Away” and “Pillowtalk”, representing the collection of his oil paintings. All his artworks can be seen on his personal website georgeslebar.com.</p><p>He is also the owner of a ranch in Wyoming, as large as 60,000 acres (approximately 242,000 square meters) which he inherited from his American grandmother, and where he spends most of his time when he is not accompanying his spouse on his trips around the world.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life_spouse_RuPaul_Andre_Charles>Personal life, spouse RuPaul Andre Charles</span></h2><p>Georges met RuPaul for the first time in 1994, in the club called “The Limelight”, located in New York City, when Georges was celebrating his birthday with friends. They instantly felt the attraction for each other –&nbsp; ‘I met him on a Monday 25 years ago. One week later, we were on Elton John’s private jet flying from London to Düsseldorf’ – RuPaul <a rel=nofollow href=#>shared</a> the story of the beginning of their relationship on his Instagram account. (He is the only one talking publicly about their relationship – Georges always keeps silent.)</p><p>In his interview for Vogue Magazine in 2019, RuPaul said that their marriage is open, as even though they were officially married, he didn’t want to put any shackles on Georges: ‘Love is free. It’s not that sort of romantic surface thing we all bought into. He is my most favorite person that I’ve met. Besides, Gore Vidal said you should never pass up an opportunity to have sex or be on television’, said RuPaul. The couple doesn’t have any kids, and RuPaul admitted he liked the quiet and peace, so Georges and RuPaul <a rel=nofollow href=#>are not even planning</a> to have kids ever. The couple kept in secret the fact of their official marriage, and RuPaul dropped they were married only in 2017. The ceremony was very private, and only their closest friends were invited to share the celebration.</p><h3><span id=Who_is_RuPaul>Who is RuPaul?</span></h3><p>RuPaul Andre Charles was born on 17 November 1960, in San Diego, California USA, however, soon after his birth, his family moved to Atlanta, Georgia. His mother’s name is Ernestine “Toni” Charles, and he has three sisters. When RuPaul was 15 years old, his sister Renetta took him to her dancing classes and also to her modeling lessons, where she showed him how to walk on the catwalk. In the 1980s he worked in the position of the filmmaker at Plaza Theatre, Atlanta. His singing debut happened on The American Music Show in 1982, at the same time he was starring in low-budget movies.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/542652976.0-1024x683.jpg></p><p>He pursued his dream to become a popular singing, while he was a backup vocalist for Vaginal Davis and Glen Meadmore. However, in the ‘90s his first album “Supermodel of the World” unexpectedly blasted the charts, and the singles from the album, such as “Supermodel (You Better Work)” and “Back to My Roots” were very popular on MTV. In 1996 he recorded his second album – “Foxy Lady” – and the next year his Christmas album “Ho Ho Ho” featured such performers as Latasha Spencer, Michelle Visage and several others. He subsequently released seven more albums, including “Born Naked” (2014), “Slay Belles” (2016) and “Butch Queen” (2017). His latest music album is called “Christmas Party”, and was released in 2018.</p><h3><span id=RuPaul8217s_Drag_Race>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></h3><p>RuPaul developed his TV hosting career from 1996. He ran his own talk show called “The RuPaul Show” aired on VH1, interviewing such celebrity guests as Diana Ross, Kurt Cobain, Backstreet Boys and many others. In 2008 he started a reality TV game show called “RuPaul’s Drag Race” aired on Logo TV channel – the show suggests weekly challenges for the contestants to become ‘America’s next drag queen’. The show has had 11 seasons, the latest finished in May 2019, awarding a prize of $100,000 to the winner (this year it was Yvie Oddly), a pack of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetic products, and a scepter and a crown custom made by Fierce Drag Jewels especially for the show. On 19 August 2019, the show was announced to have been renewed for the twelfth season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Viva Drag Vegas! <a rel=nofollow href=#>#DragRace</a> Sets Live Show In Las&nbsp;Vegas <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/dYeIHDNjay</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/tuohGzWUOB</a></p><p>— RuPaul (@RuPaul) <a rel=nofollow href=#>September 12, 2019</a></p><h3><span id=Awards>Awards</span></h3><p>RuPaul’s impact on the drag industry couldn’t go unnoticed. For all the work RuPaul has done for promoting equality and the interests of the LGBT community, he was presented with the Vito Russo Award in 1999 at the GLAAD Media Awards. For his dedication to his own show – “The RuPaul’s Drag Race” – he won his first Emmy in 2016, and then got another one – the Primetime Emmy Award in the category “Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program” – in 2017. (RuPaul admitted his colleague, friend and supporter Michelle Visage helped it happen.) The same year RuPaul was included in the Top100 list of the most influential people in the whole world.</p><p>In 2019 he received the Reality Host Emmy Award, <a rel=nofollow href=#>dedicating</a> it to the late “Drag Race” producer Jacqueline Wilson. In 2019 Integrity Dolls produced two dolls of RuPaul.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_favorite_things_and_interesting_facts>Hobbies, favorite things and interesting facts</span></h2><p>George likes traveling very much, and RuPaul often posts their mutual photos on his Instagram account, which is followed by more than 3.5 million subscribers, sharing the highlights of their vacations, trips, etc. The couple likes visiting Miami, Hawaii and often goes to Australia to visit Georges’ family there. George also likes poetry. Along with RuPaul he likes visiting various arts events, such as the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Frieze London Art Fair</a>.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_clothing_style>Appearance, clothing style</span></h2><p>George has black hair and brown eyes; he sports a mustache and beard, which is a bit grey already. He is 6ft 7ins (2.01m) tall and weighs around 216lbs (98kgs); his vital statistics are 44-34-38. As to his clothing style, he and his spouse RuPaul often wear denim trousers, turquoise jewelry, and Italian cowboy boots and cowboy hats while they are on their ranch. When they both appear at official events, they both wear classy suits.</p><h2><span id=Net_worth_and_salary>Net worth and salary</span></h2><p>As of 2019, Georges’ net worth is estimated to be around $1.5 million, while his spouse RuPaul has a net worth of <a rel=nofollow href=#>$60 million</a>. As RuPaul’s show “The RuPaul Drag Race” is going to premiere its twelfth season, and his other businesses and endeavors also give him a very stable income, his wealth seems very likely to increase.</p>, <a href=#>Wikipedia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmraCVYsKvwM6lm2asoqrBqXnOn2SrraCWwq2%2FjKGsrJqRo7Fus8SoqaCdo2K5pq7Aq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-we-ve-lost-in-2012.html><span>←</span><span>Stars Weve Lost in 2012</span></a>
