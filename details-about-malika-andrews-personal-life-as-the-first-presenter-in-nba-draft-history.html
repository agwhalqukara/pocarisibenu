Let’s find out if they have any chance of being correct.</p><p>Andrews, Malika Rose Aka American sports writer and reporter Malika Andrews was born on January 27, 1995. She serves as the host of NBA Today, which replaced The Jump. She began working as an online NBA columnist for ESPN in October 2018. She made her sideline reporting debut during the 2020 NBA Bubble as the network’s youngest sideline reporter. Andrews was chosen as one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in the sports industry for 2021.</p><p>Additionally, Andrews was chosen to replace Rachel Nichols as ABC’s sideline reporter for the NBA Finals coverage on July 6, 2021. Nichols was let go after audio of her criticizing the network for giving commentator Maria Taylor the lead Finals host post was made public.</p><p>Malika Andrews is she wed and has a husband?</p><p>Malika Andrews has not yet tied the knot with a husband. Nevertheless, Malika Andrews frequently makes press headlines owing to her partner, relationship, and dating rumors. Malika Andrews hasn’t yet revealed who her future husband or lover is, despite the rumors.</p><p>Malika Andrews, on the other hand, acknowledged that she and her partner were living in New York City at the start of the outbreak in 2020. She and her colleague prepared interview questions for the NBA Finals champion before the Milwaukee Bucks won the championship. In 2021, Malika moved from New York to Los Angeles, where she is presently the ESPN host of NBA Today.</p><p>Discussion of the Dave McMenamin and Malika Andrews relationship rumors</p><p>Malika Andrews and Dave McMenamin, two of the most renowned and well-known reporters in the NBA, are said to be dating. Dave McMenamin primarily covers the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers for ESPN as a TV reporter and beat writer. ESPN journalist Malika Andrews serves as the anchor of NBA Today, which replaced The Jump.</p><p>On May 22, online rumors of a relationship between Malika Andrews and Dave McMenamin appeared, setting off a social media frenzy. The initial rumors of a relationship between Malika Andrews and Dave McMenamin appeared on Twitter on Sunday night (May 22).</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-31181 alt="Malika Andrews" width=225 height=225 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Malika-Andrews.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-31181 class=wp-caption-text>Malika Andrews</p><p>The rumors seemed to be connected to a picture of the couple taken at a particular event. According to Getty Images, the image is from the Netflix original series “Colin In Black And White,” which will debut in 2021. E. McIntyre The picture was tweeted by the account @LakeShowYo, which has more than 234k followers, along with the caption “Nah someone told me this ain’t true.”</p><p>Is Malika Andrews’s new boyfriend Dave McMenamin?</p><p>Due to the reports, people wondered if Malika Andrews and Dave McMenamin were dating. Although neither party has confirmed or denied the rumors, there has never been a romantic relationship between the two.</p><p>In actuality, the Twitter source is also not fully trustworthy. @LakeShowYo has amassed a sizable following by publishing hilarious but occasionally misleading satire and parody, much like other well-known NBA Twitter accounts (Ball**** Sports, to name one). As there have been no earlier reports of the two dating, we should thus consider the speculations to be speculative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJWprqq40maYm6elqXqurcuiopplkaOxs7HWrGSpnaKovK%2Bty2ajop6VYq60edOhnGaemafAtXnPq5ysnZ6psrN5yKdkp5qRYrGzrcWtZKGho6m8s8WO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./4kq-surges-in-latest-radio-ratings-at-nova-s-expense.html><span>←</span><span>4KQ surges in latest radio ratings at Novas expense</span></a>
