Brown and Spicer were both on the list, with the latter causing quite the backlash for DWTS. Even <a href=#>host Tom Bergeron</a> was against the casting of the disgraced political aid.</p><p>Brown decided to weigh in on all the backlash, especially after one Twitter user expressed disappointment in the Queer Eye star for “lending his celebrity” to the show.</p><p>https://twitter.com/alexdavi21/status/1164379405650673664?s=20</p><p>“First, I have no say who is on the cast and didn’t find out till this morning that he is on! But I’ll tell you this. I’m excited to sit down w/ him and engage in a respectful conversation. Only way things get better is if we try to educate those who have different POV than us,” he responded.</p><p>His words did nothing to keep the haters at bay. Brown immediately followed up with a now-deleted Tweet.</p><p>“But I understand how my comments could lead people to believe that I don’t understand the gravity of the situation. The personal is political. I’m reminded of it daily as a gay man of color. I know that representation matters that it can affect change. I see you & I hear you. I’m bringing my personal message of love, equity & inclusion to the dance floor. I want it to eclipse & triumph over divisiveness & hatred,” the 38-year-old expressed.</p><p>Brown only made matters worse when he referred to Spicer as a “good guy” and a “really sweet guy” in an interview with Access Hollywood.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who gave you permission, haters? <a href=# rel=nofollow>#QueerEye</a>'s <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Karamo</a> is defending his fellow <a href=# rel=nofollow>#DWTS</a> contestant Sean Spicer: "He's a good guy." ❤️️ <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/A1wDdFFZi2</a></p><p>— Access Hollywood (@accesshollywood) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 21, 2019</a></p><p>The hate and criticism over his comments on Sean Spicer being cast on DWTS have caused Queer Eye star Karamo Brown to delete his Twitter account. At first, the reality TV star was only blocking those who chose to come at him with nasty, angry comments.</p><p>Once he was called out for using the block function, Brown chose to stop the problem by shutting down Twitter. He still has an Instagram account, but the comments function has been disabled.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>There has been no word from the Netflix star, but his friend and Queer Eye colleague, Bobby Berk, send out a series of Tweets defending Brown. Those were also deleted after Berk came under fire for his words.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGehqrKmvoyesJ5lo6mus3nKmqmapZ9ir7O71qdknZ2cmsGmv4ytrqKspJq%2Fbq3FrZyrZaOarq950qmgnJ2iYrG4wNJmmqimpKe8t7HRrLBma2FpgnaFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./potential-nfl-trade-packages-for-players-who-need-a-fresh-start-news-scores-highlights-stats-a.html><span>←</span><span>Potential NFL Trade Packages for Players Who Need a Fresh Start | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, a</span></a>
