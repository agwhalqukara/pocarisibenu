Obviously, Urie is not a supporter and he would rather not be associated with the Donald or his campaign in any way."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Tom wrote this song [I Won’t Back Down] for the underdog, the common man, for EVERYONE….We believe in America and in democracy. But Donald Trump’s not representing the noble ideas of either. Concurrently, we have issued an official cease and desist notice to the Trump campaign.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Others that did and said similar things upon finding out Trump had used their music were: R.E.M, Guns N’ Roses’ Axl Rose, The Rolling Stones, Pharrell Williams, Queen and more!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7KvsM6nZK6qmZp6pb7AoKpmnJ%2Bjrq2wjK2prqWgYq6nwMSrZKWdkae7qrrGZp%2BeZaWosqV5x6KqZqufo7RurdNmq66ko5Z6s63LpbBmbGBugHl8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./think-about-this-more-2-wds.html><span>←</span><span>___ think about this more ...: 2 wds.</span></a>
