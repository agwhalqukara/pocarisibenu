"When I feel stressed, I turn to food for comfort," she explains on the brand's website. "After doing a juice cleanse, I'm motivated to eat healthier and not emotionally." She also maintains that cleansing is meditative for her. "It makes me stop, focus and think about what I'm putting into my body. I'm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/salma-hayek-getty-2.jpg><p><span>Salma eats a primarily plant-based diet with meat sprinkled in. "The only thing I do is that I don't eat animals every day. I eat all kinds of meat, but I consume it sparsely," she explained to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>New York Times</span></a><span>. "I would never eat two meats in a day. Sometimes I go several days without eating meat, but then I'll go back."&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/salma-hayek-getty-3.jpg><p><span>Salma isn't into following a strict diet. "I don't like to diet and I'm not good at it," she wrote on her Cooler Cleanse website. "Everybody has a weakness and mine is food," she added to More.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/salma-hayek-getty-4.jpg><p><span>Salma eats a lot of fruits and veggies and aims for colorful meals. One of her favorites? Her "breakfast special," a chopped up salad of papaya, blueberries, mango, strawberries, pomegranate seeds, celery, red pepper, and cucumber, atop almond and coconut butter and yogurt. "It doesn't sound like it tastes great but it's delicious," she dished on </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/salma-hayek-getty-5.jpg><p><span>You won't find Salma breaking a sweat via an intense workout method. "Some people have the discipline to exercise in the morning, and I didn't develop that," she explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "I work with a woman in London who taught me how to hold my body in a way where the muscles are activated all day long. So even when you brush your teeth, you're working the muscles," she added. "It's restorative yoga. She taught me how to tone [my muscles] without clenching them. You relax them and focus on the parts that need to be used, but never with tension. If you're aware of your body, you'd be surprised by the effect it can have."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/salma-hayek-getty-6.jpg><p><span>Salma is all about self-care practices, including getting a regular rubdown. "Massage oxygenates, activates the circulation, and keeps the muscles healthy and firm. I cannot tell you, even just for the lymphatic [system], what the massage does for the face," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Vogue</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/salma-hayek-getty-1.jpg><p><span>Salma is a big proponent of meditation. "It makes you experience your body with a lightness that's really delicious and satisfying," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>InStyle</span></a><span>. "With the breathing and the going inside, you explore your body in a different way, and you learn not to go crazy with the expectations."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkrJmcoq5utMCynKRlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyfmqqVqHqvu4ymmKSdpaV6tLHLn6Ceq5GhuqJ5x5qwnqNdnrtursCtn6Kml2LAtrXTZqqhmaKawG66zmakmqOVqr1uv8SlnaKdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-lupita-karizma-lupillo-rivera-s-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Lupita Karizma, Lupillo Rivera's Daughter</span></a>
