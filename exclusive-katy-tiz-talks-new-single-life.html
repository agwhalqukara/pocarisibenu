Recorded while Tiz was suffering from&nbsp;laryngitis the result is a much less polished, stripped back sound that is absolutely perfect for the song.</p><p></p><p>Here we speak exclusively to Katy Tiz to find out more about ‘Life’:</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little about the inspiration behind the song?</strong><br>Well, the verses of ‘Life’ are fictional. I haven’t stolen my dads money or a car recently but the hook is something we can all relate to. It’s that horrible feeling when you lose something or someone you love and you feel as though you’re going to have that feeling for Life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What was the writing process like for this track?</strong><br>Originally the boys (my bro, his partner, and Ed) got stuck in [the studio] and wrote this one together. It was one of those long days where nothing magical happens in the studio and then they were just about to give up and bam… ‘Life’ began. As soon as I heard it I fell in love with it and bugged them until they let me come in and put my stamp on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What was your favourite thing about working with Ed Drewett for this track?</strong><br>Ed is amazing! My bros have worked with him for years. I’ve always been a fan of his work (who isn’t), and we actually recorded our vocal’s separately which made it easy for me because I just listened to his vocals and it really helped me zone out and echo what he was doing. AKA turn the lights off in the vocal booth and be all weird.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What was the studio vibe like when you were recording the song?</strong><br>Well, when I recorded it I had laryngitis which actually really adds to the rasp. When I spoke I sounded like old lady who smokes 50 a day and has loads of cats but it worked out well for my singing that day!</p><p><strong>What do you hope fans take from the single?</strong><br>I just want them to bloody love it! And learn the words so we can sing it together (they can help me when I forget the words).</p><p>Make sure you follow Katy Tiz on Twitter <a href=#>@KatyTiz</a> to keep up to date with all her music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with Katy Tiz?
