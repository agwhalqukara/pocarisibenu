It was the “13th time in a row that he’s lost,” Arnett said, adding that Kimmel had drowned his emotions backstage.</p><p>It was a funny skit, but when Brunson walked onto the stage to accept her first Emmy award for her ABC sitcom Abbott Elementary, Kimmel was still on stage, lying next to Brunson, which made it difficult to record Brunson’s speech without taking&nbsp;Kimmel&nbsp;in the screen.</p><p>Kimmel was awakened by Brunson, who jokingly said, “Hey Jimmy, get up. I won.” Kimmel gave a thumbs up in response but didn’t get up and seemed to think his sketch was too funny to end. Brunson decided to ignore him and resumed her victory speech after a few embarrassing stares down. Arnett politely dragged Kimmel off stage after she was finished because Kimmel stuck with the joke all the way through.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jimmy Kimmel should have left the stage during Quinta’s speech.
