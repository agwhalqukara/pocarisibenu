Ralph, who initially shared the recording on TikTok, captioned the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> “It’s summertime! Follow me!! Video by @ivycoco23.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-30-at-12.26.10-PM-e1622393729908-600x383.png><p>Many fans expressed upon viewing the video how good Ralph looked at 64 years old. One Instagram user even referenced Ralph as her character Dee Mitchell from the popular sitcom “Moesha.” Ralph played Dee Mitchell, the matriarch of the 1990s show that starred Brandy. The series initially aired on UPN from 1996 to 2001.</p><p>“She giving that pageant swim suit walk! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 come on now!!! 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️.”</p><p>“Wow she looks so BOMB 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥Black don’t crack baby!!!”</p><p>“If “black don’t crack” was a person😍😍🔥.”</p><p>“These older black women are shutting it the f*ck down, okay! She is STUNNING! Come on BAWDY! Come on Dee! 😍”</p><p>“Come on Auntie with the natural curves!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/756FF8D7-5C16-4D0E-9022-39A21861A3F6-600x314.jpeg><p>Among the many compliments that Ralph received for her head-turning video, one came from her “Moesha” co-star and on-screen stepson <strong>Marcus Paulk</strong>. Paulk, who played Miles Mitchell in the show, humorously expressed his sentiments by asking his on-screen father Frank Mitchell portrayed by&nbsp;<strong>William Allen Young</strong> to “come get” the actress.</p><p>Paulk said underneath The Shade Room’s comment section following the repost of Ralph’s initial bikini upload, “Ayeeee DAD. Come get Dee!!! 🗣. 😂 @williamallenyoung The original diva do ya thang @thesherylleeralph aka my other mom.”</p><p>Ralph has discussed the longevity and long-lasting impact “Moesha,” which is currently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">streaming</a> on Netflix, has had on youth. The actress said during an interview with the Chicago Tribune last <a href=#>year</a>, “Young people who never saw this show are&nbsp;reaching out&nbsp;to me and telling me they are longing for something like this. They want to see themselves. They want to see happy people — they want to see a happy family and a happy&nbsp;Black&nbsp;family, you better put respect on that part.”</p><p>She added, “It’s been amazing to hear that. Or to hear from people who are 35 or 40 say, ‘I hated you when I was a kid! But I’m watching the show now and I love you!’ It’s because Dee was so strict, but they’re older now and understand the guidance that I was trying to give all the children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49uZmxpX6i1pnnGoq2ippdiwamt02anmp%2BVlru1edKwoKarpZ7BbsPApaJmq5iav7q4jKWcnmWilrmxtIysq66mo2KzorrSZqCnZZFir6q3yKegZq6ZmbKwecCtZG9sXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brother-of-cain-and-seth.html><span>←</span><span>Brother of Cain and Seth</span></a>
