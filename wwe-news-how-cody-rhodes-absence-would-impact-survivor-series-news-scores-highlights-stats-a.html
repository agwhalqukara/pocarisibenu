A decade or so ago, he likely would have been allowed to participate in the match if he chose to. Now, with focus on brain damage and concussions, it’s obvious that Rhodes should stay out of the ring for the near future.</p><p>Most wrestlers have a daredevil personality—no injury will keep them out of the ring. Staying out of Survivor Series won’t hurt Rhodes' brand or his fans. The show will go on, and fans will look at Rhodes as a smart man for it.</p><p>As a result, the WWE Intercontinental Champion can be pushed to the forefront as a model example for young athletes. How can he do it? By easing up and recognizing when injury takes precedence. &nbsp;</p><p>We're headed that way. Barring an unforeseen turn, Rhodes will sit at Survivor Series.</p><p>But what of Team Ziggler? Tensai, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will reportedly replace</a> Rhodes to go up against Team Foley (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PW Insider</a>). Yes Matt Bloom, also known as Tensai, is the “next man up." Bloom has just turned 40 and portrays a Japanese student who just learned the fine craft of Japanese fighting. I wouldn’t hold your collective breath.</p><p>In comparison to Rhodes, Tensai is a bit older with an inferior gimmick and not much fanfare. While the WWE Intercontinental Champion would have had a prominent part against Team Foley, I don’t expect a noteworthy contribution from Tensai.</p><p>If Team Ziggler is meant to win their matchup against Foley and Co., it won’t matter whether Tensai or Rhodes wrestles. The match results have already been written for this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG1pYmaBeXnWsJxmppWswG60zrBknKeUrnqztM6dnKxlkZfAprrCnmSwp6WhsW61zKmYnKxdqMKzwsivpqtlo5q%2FqrHS</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toya-wright-is-grateful-to-everyone-who-came-out-to-the-5k-walk-run-event-to-fight-against-obesity.html><span>←</span><span>Toya Wright Is Grateful To Everyone Who Came Out To The 5k Walk/Run Event To Fight Against Obesity</span></a>
