Though the event had been planned prior to last week’s big announcement, the Supreme Court of the United States’ ruling legalizing same-sex marriage made it that much sweeter as <strong>Dana Panzer</strong> and <strong>Amy Wicker</strong> tied the knot.</p><p>Biel, 33, who was roommates at Tufts University with Panzer, danced up a storm at the soiree. One eyewitness said, “She looked amazing. You would never know she just had a baby because she is slim and trim."</p><p>Biel and her hubby, 34, left baby <strong>Silas</strong>, 2 months, at home, but the Grammy-winning star did offer up an extra special wedding gift for the newlyweds. Sitting down at a keyboard, the former boy bander rocked out to his hit “Señorita.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Imma start something, and all the fellahs gonna look at the ladies, who just got married tonight. And all the ladies gonna look at the ladies, you know what I’m saying,” he began.&nbsp;</p><p>The two brides then danced as Timberlake continued to sing, busting out other hits, including “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Throughout the night, Justin really let loose and he started dancing in the middle of the wedding circle having an amazing time dancing to this great band,” another eyewitness tells Us. “Then Justin decided he wanted to put on a little concert for the two brides and he jumped on the stage. It was awesome and so special for the brides and all the guests who were so impressed!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGuq6Seu27AyKaZnqqclrimec%2BeqZ%2BnoqLAbsPEnZuippdit6a%2F0qKammWSnrKtedGopqalkamybn6PamxrcWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-gosselin-s-kids-hannah-and-collin-are-really-close-to-his-gf-colleen-conrad-they-alread.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Gosselins Kids Hannah And Collin Are Really Close To His GF Colleen Conrad They Alread</span></a>
