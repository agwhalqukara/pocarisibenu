New O2 customers, or existing customers who are upgrading their plan, can get <b>up to 6 free months of Disney+</b>.</p><p>Also, Apple TV offer a free trial for seven days but just remember that the subscription will renew automatically at £4.99/a month, so don’t forget to cancel if you don’t want it anymore.</p><p>Netflix is available on your smartphone, tablet, smart TV, laptop or streaming device, all for one fixed monthly fee. Plans range from £5.99 to £13.99 a month. No extra costs, no contracts.</p><p>Many took to Twitter to share their theories with some even hitting out at the Sheffield born star for not complying with the Halloween theme.</p><p>One viewer questioned: “How is a lobster halloweeny?”</p><p>A second tweeted: “I’m really struggling to see the connection between Halloween and lobsters.”</p><p>A third added: “Dance not too bad considering but song choice and costume awful. Sorry.”</p><p>However, Dan’s army of fans were out in force to defend him.</p><p>One fan tweeted: “Ridiculous that people were angry that Dan and Nadiya had gone for the lobster theme.</p><p>“I have a lot of admiration and respect for Dan standing up for his Christian faith and not following the typical Halloween theme.</p><p>“Hope your family enjoy the Light Party!”</p><p>Another added: “Ignore the weird angry comments… You brighten up the Strictly dancefloor and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>“Love watching you as without any history of dance training you have improved so much, loved the lobsters,” said another supportive fan.</p><p>Dan addressed the comments and thanked viewers for their ongoing support, acknowledging the somewhat “weird and angry” comments.</p><p>He wrote: “So many amazing comments about last night (& a few weird angry ones) Thanks for voting. I know I’m not the best dancer but I’m having a wonderful time learning from @NadiyaBychkova. So much quality on #Strictly this year. I voted for @RoseAylingEllis who is simply tremendous.”</p><p>Strictly Come Dancing will return tonight with the results show as two couples will face the dreaded dance off.</p><p><b><i>To get the latest email updates from Yorkshire Live,</i> </b><b><i>click here</i> </b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq6SntqTAy7JknKedmnqlrc2coKefXZuur7%2BMoZivnV2ptaa70bJkmpqfqsFusMCnZLCZnKCys7%2BMpaabq6Sav26vzqyrrqWVYq6vsIywn7Jlmal6uK3Sp6tmoJGhubDDxJ6lZrFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spencer-lofranco-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Spencer Lofranco Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
