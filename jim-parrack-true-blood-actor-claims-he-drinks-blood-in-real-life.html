<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Jim Parrack, True Blood Actor, Claims He Drinks Blood in Real Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Well, this gives new meaning to the term "bloodthirsty." True Blood actor <strong>Jim Parrack</strong>, who's played Hoyt Fortenberry on the HBO show since the first season, told <a href=#>Vulture</a> recently that he occasionally likes to indulge in a little real-life blood-sucking. Parrack apparently mentioned his taste for blood in passing on the opening night of Broadway's Of Mice and Men&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;and he claims he wasn't kidding around. (Unless he's kidding about that, too!)</span></p><p>"I was being literal. I like the real deal," he told the site. Asked why, he replied, "Um, I guess for the same reason some people want alcohol? Or for the same reason some people want, I don't know…milk? Or Kool-Aid?"</p><p><span>The actor said, though, that he doesn't drink it on a "regular" basis&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;just "a couple times a year" when the mood strikes him. "It's more like on an impulse," Parrack, 33, explained. "When you make me spell it out like this, it sounds strange, but I just want to be clear&nbsp;</span><span>—</span><span>&nbsp;that night, I was being literal. There was something about that night where I had that impulse. I guess the best way to put it is sometimes I just like the way it tastes."</span></p><p>It can't be just anyone's blood, though. Like <strong>Stephen Moyer</strong>'s Bill Compton at the beginning of the series, Parrack prefers the blood of his beloved. (He recently split from his wife of six years and is now engaged to Hunger Games actress Leven Rambin.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm absolutely particular," he told Vulture, laughing, noting that the thought of animal blood from a butcher doesn't appeal to him. He also stressed that he's not "getting a glass of it" to drink&nbsp;<span>—</span>&nbsp;just enough to satisfy his craving.&nbsp;</p><p>"It does something to you emotionally," he said. "It's hard to describe."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGipV2lrrO%2BwJyiZqyiqrJursuopp1lkZjBsL6MpaCknaNiwbB5w6ugp6Ndl7mwu8NmoKdlopqurXnLop2eZWJlfnV9lnE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./comedian-justin-martindale-draws-the-line-w-heather-mcdonald.html><span>←</span><span>Comedian Justin Martindale 'Draws The Line' w/ Heather McDonald</span></a>
