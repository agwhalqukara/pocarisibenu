The situation worked out well for Harbaugh, though, as he went back to the University of Michigan for two more seasons, reaching the College Football Playoff twice and winning a national title last season.</p><p>L.A. entered the draft with the No. 5 overall pick, putting it in an advantageous position. The Chargers did not need a quarterback with Justin Herbert already on the roster, meaning they could shop the pick to quarterback-needy teams.</p><p>However, they may have lost some of their bargaining power when quarterbacks Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye went off the board as the top three picks.</p><p>After the Arizona Cardinals took Ohio State wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. with the fourth overall pick, the Chargers stayed at No. 5 and took Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt, giving them arguably the most promising offensive tackle duo in the NFL between Alt and Rashawn Slater.</p><p>The Vikings watched as another quarterback was taken eighth overall when the Atlanta Falcons selected Michael Penix Jr., leaving only two potential first-round quarterbacks on the board.</p><p>In a likely effort to prevent the Denver Broncos from trading ahead of them, the Vikings moved up one spot from No. 11 to No. 10 in a trade with the New York Jets to secure J.J. McCarthy.</p><p>Coincidentally, Harbaugh coached McCarthy at Michigan, and they went undefeated and won a national championship together in 2023.</p><p>Unless the Vikings wanted Penix, they may have gotten their guy by moving up only one spot rather than five.</p><p>As for Harbaugh and the Chargers, Alt solidifies their offensive line and should go a long way toward giving Herbert more time to throw.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmV%2BdYSMp52lZZWtsqR51qilnZ2iqHqqsoyjoKZlmJa%2Fo63UoJ9mnJmZu7V506uYnZ1do7xugYypoJyjXam8bsLIpKCnn6NivLbAjKidZqqVqLKvwMyepa0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./modelling-material-10-letters-crossword-clue-answer.html><span>←</span><span>Modelling material 10 Letters Crossword Clue Answer</span></a>
