The redheaded royal, 29, <a href=# rel=noopener>is in South America this week</a> to tour Brazil and Chile, while taking in some World Cup games and mingling with the locals—and one local in particular.</p><p>TV personality <strong>Sabrina Sato</strong>, who hosts various programs and appeared on Big Brother Brazil, rubbed shoulders with Harry at a reception for the Queen’s birthday party in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Wednesday evening, June 25.</p><p>As they spoke at the swanky affair, Sato, 33, extended an invitation to the royal for a party in her country next year. She wore a pair of six-inch Christian Louboutin heels and a cream minidress, which showed off her toned figure.</p><p>“We really enjoyed chatting,” Sato, who has posed for Playboy Brazil, tells Us. “I invited him to come to Carnival in February and he said he would come. I will show him how we party in Brazil!… He’s extremely handsome, and a real gentleman.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prince Harry, who wore a navy suit with a powder blue tie, showed his gentlemanly qualities at the event, where he met with the British Ambassador to Brazil Alexander Ellis and the Sao Paulo Consul General John Doddrell. He gave an impressive speech to the crowd, which included model Alessandra Ambrosio, at the soiree honoring the queen, speaking highly of both the matriarch and the country that hosted them.</p><p>“I am delighted to celebrate the official birthday of Her Majesty with you this evening, and especially pleased to do so in Brazil, a country with whom the United Kingdom has such broad and strong relations,” he said in his speech. “This is my second visit to Brazil and I am delighted to have the opportunity to explore a little more of this wonderfully vibrant and fascinating country. In particular, to be here in the city of Sao Paulo, the economic hub of Brazil and one of the biggest cities in the world. Once again, I have been struck by the warmth of the welcome I have received, in Brasilia, Belo Horizonte and here in Sao Paulo, a place which has a long history of links to the United Kingdom.”</p><p>Harry’s love of Brazil also struck a chord with Sato, who added to Us, “This is the second time he has been in Brazil and I love how he has shown great care and love for the country. You can tell by watching and listening to him how passionate he is about the country. When he takes part in events here you can tell he is genuine and not just doing it because it is his work. He has passion and I find that really impressive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKeroZ6Ysm60wKupsmWdmrK1v4ybqZqymaG2orqMm5yaraSuerStwaugp5ldqK61u4yampydoKnAbq7RmrGipF2lrrPA2GZpaWlkZ4N3</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./park-ritzy-area-in-manhattan-abbr.html><span>←</span><span>Park ___ (ritzy area in Manhattan): Abbr.</span></a>
