The skin sees Morty don a mecha-suit and its corresponding cosmetics include a backpack backbling, and a space-snake pickaxe.</p><p>Both the Mike Lowery and J Balvin skins are far simpler, with the designs intended to resemble the real-life appearance of these two stars. Both of these characters will seemingly come with a set of associated cosmetics. For J Balvin these are the “Real” backbling and pickaxe, “In Da Party” emote and “Balvin Cruiser” glider. Along with the Mike Lowery outfit, according to the leaks, players can purchase the “Detective’s Duffle” backbling and “Loose Cannon Cutters” pickaxes.</p><p>With nothing confirmed by Epic, players will have to wait before they can get their hands on these skins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6mytLzOq6usZpOkunCyzqurp6GkmnyvsdasZp2ZpJa6qrrEq6pmpJWWuG7BzaucpZ2RqLKlecWoqa2mmamybr%2FKoqWsZZmjsK3Bw6KloGWnnrmtedKmoK2go2KvorCMm6ayq12YtaK%2BwJyrnqpdoryzwNhmnaunnWK%2Fqq%2FKZpinnF2ivLPA2GaYp5xdn3qjrcuvoKdlmZi8r3nSnqminaM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coronation-street-spoilers-jenny-connor-realises-sharon-bentley-is-up-to-no-good.html><span>←</span><span>Coronation Street spoilers: Jenny Connor realises Sharon Bentley is up to no good</span></a>
