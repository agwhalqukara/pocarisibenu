Whether it's making a pun, taking advantage of news, playing off a player's appearance or skill, or even capitalizing on an inside joke, funny fantasy names are all the rage.&nbsp;</p><p>The number of funny fantasy names is endless. Thanks to a constant stream of information, opportunities continue to present themselves to fantasy owners looking to break the mold with a team name.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some fresh, hysterical team names to consider for this season. Grab them while they're hot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s Always Runny in Philadelphia</strong></p><p><span>Fantasy owners drafting a member of the Philadelphia Eagles offense and&nbsp;owners from the city itself&nbsp;should enjoy this one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Heck, even fans of the outstanding show&nbsp;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia&nbsp;should consider it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With new head coach Chip Kelly in town, star running back LeSean McCoy will see more carries than ever. So will quarterback Michael Vick, who says he'll be a "threat" in the run game, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach Berman of The&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fans have seen how fast Chip Kelly ran his teams at Oregon. Now that he's with the Eagles, there's going to be plenty of running in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>J.J. S.W.A.T.T. Team</strong></p><p><span>This one goes out to the IDP players out there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In case fans have not heard, Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt is pretty good.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the things that makes Watt such a great player is his ability to swat passes down at the line of scrimmage, which he did a ridiculous 16 times last season, as fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">can watch here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Playing in a league that includes defensive players? First of all, congratulations on playing the most demanding and rewarding type of league. Secondly, pick up J.J. Watt. Just do it.</span></p><p><strong>Dumervil's Copy & Fax</strong></p><p>Opening a copy and fax store? Elvis Dumervil should be first on the list of clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of who or what was responsible for the major error, the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens ended up landing Dumervil via free agency.&nbsp;</p><p>This fantasy name is not a horrible way to go for multiple reasons, but using it in a league with Broncos fans would be ideal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>J-Ville RedZone Channel</strong></p><p>That's no shocker, as the Jaguars need to find creative ways to get fans to games. The team won a total of seven games in 2011 and 2012, and it experienced its last winning season in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, it's an interesting move by the front office. Allowing fans to watch the same thing they can watch from the comfort of their homes sounds enticing. Or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, Jacksonville has provided fans with a quality fake football name yet again.&nbsp;</p><p><span>New York Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith has a long way to go in the NFL. That much was apparent by his Week 3 preseason effort<span>—</span>he threw three interceptions and stepped out of the back of the end zone under his own power for a safety.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href=#>Rex Ryan</a> and the Jets are always good sources of fantasy names and overall entertainment. Smith got the ball rolling here, but it's safe to say they are just getting started.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Jets may have to do the NFL's version of dialing 911 soon by preparing to pick in the top of next year's draft.</p><p><strong>I'm Sorry Fred Jackson</strong></p><p><span><span>There was a time when Buffalo Bills running back Fred Jackson was a serious threat in the world of fantasy football.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Back in 2011, Jackson was dominant in Buffalo, tallying over 900 yards and six scores through just 11 games. Jackson then went down with an injury and has never been the same.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Buffalo has moved on to greener pastures and now starts electric speed back <a href=#>C.J. Spiller</a> while Jackson rides the pine. Last year, Jackson managed just over 400 yards rushing, and the fantasy forecast is not much better this year.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Going with this name, which is based on a quality song, will allow owners to tip their hats to Mr. Jackson's once-great fantasy potential.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Follow B/R's Chris Roling on Twitter for more news and analysis&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Chris_Roling</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaHBtZGiAeXnFmqWtmaOueqe7zq2ZmqScYn9xfZJmn6KfmKG2qLTToqWgZZaqu6%2FFjJqlnWWlo7GmvtGaq56cXamyormMp5imnaM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./discover-chappell-roan-and-her-single-good-hurt.html><span>←</span><span>DISCOVER: Chappell Roan and her single 'Good Hurt'</span></a>
