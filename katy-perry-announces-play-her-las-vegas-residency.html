She will be playing 8 shows in total- December 31 and January 1, 7, 8, 12, 14, and 15. Tickets and VIP Packages go on sale on May 24. The Pre-sale begins on May 17.

She will join Celine Dion, Carrie Underwood, and fellow American Idol judge, Luke Bryan, who will all have residencies there in the next few months.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>This announcement comes days before Perry is set to release “Electric,” a song she collaborated with Pokemon on for their 25th anniversary, which she will most likely sing at the residency.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Just last August, Perry released her fifth studio album,<a href=#> “Smile,”</a> days after giving birth to her first child, with fiancée Orlando Bloom. So, as the world is opening back up, is this it as far as a tour is concerned? Is she playing it safe, so she can be home with her daughter or will Perry announce a full-length tour after her residency ends? Only time will tell.</p><p>With Perry’s talent and knack for putting on a show, there’s no doubt this residency will be a hit. We only wonder what songs she will perform.</p><p>So gimme some cash out and get the hell out of town and go see Perry in what will sure be a show stopping performance.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Will you be going to one of the shows?
