The America’s Next Top Model All-Stars winner, 31, worried her fans on Twitter Jan. 19 after she posted a picture of her bloody face from the hospital.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: America’s Next Top Model All-Stars contestants</a></p><p>“This is real. I broke my nose last night folks!” she <a href=#>announced</a> with the photo. “Got rushed to the plastic surgeon and now I’m finished. Who wants to hang out? Lol JK. But seriously, I’m fine . . . I need to chill on my gymnastics. I’ll be back to normal in a month. I hope I like my new nose!”</p><p>D’Amato broke her nose and injured her forehead and lip while goofing around on the Colorado set of the upcoming indie film, Cowboys and Indians.</p><p>“I am very lucky that as a dancer, gymnast, and stage performer that I’ve never gotten hurt from it. With all my daring antics, I’ve been so blessed all my life when it comes to that,” she explained on Twitter. “Even though I broke my nose last night from my ‘daring shenanigans,’ I still refuse to live in fear. My face (supposedly) will look even better when it’s healed — which is a silver lining in this situation — but also, I finally got my share of injury/ pain from the universe to remind me to be more careful. I’ll be fine everyone!”</p><p><strong>(WARNING: GRAPHIC PICTURE BELOW!)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>And she really is healing very nicely. D’Amato, who was named the winner of America’s Next Top Model All-Stars in December 2011, posted a makeup-free updated photo of how her face has been healing. She also apologized to fans if her previous photos scared them.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They are real,” she said of the images, “but I am recovering very well. So well, that I’ll have no scars and look even better.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I guess I’m a bit of a tomboy — not vanity obsessed — so I’m not too concerned about showing the ugly part of life,” she explained. “I was not doing a crazy acrobatic move. It was quite easy actually — one I’ve done with a partner since I was a child. It truly was a strange freak accident. Truth is — s–t happens! But I will be just fine and will jump right back into my career being better and stronger than ever!”</p><p>“Once again, I apologize if I scared you!” D’Amato added. “As you can see I’m doing just fine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOiq5FisaK5wK2mZpmdmr%2Bqr8CsZKedqKl6tbvPZqSonJWheqK4y2aqrZmiqHq4tc2nnKtlmaO3tr7ErGSfmZOaeqq6jKyrq5menLJustGemKRlkZiwqrDEp6tmamBmgHOBkA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-burroughs-bio-age-married-nationality-net-worth-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Burroughs - Bio, Age, Married, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
