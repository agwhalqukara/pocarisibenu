After a tense visit to the Forger household — followed by friction between its patriarch and matriarch — it looks like things are back to normal. Of course, Twilight still needs to work on Operation Strix. A dodgeball game at Eden College could complicate that endeavor. So, what’s the release date and time for Spy x Famly Episode 10?</p><p><strong>[Warning: Spoilers ahead for <a href=#>Spy x Family Episode 9</a>, “Show Off How in Love You Are.”]</strong></p><h2 id=h-spy-x-family-episode-9-saw-twilight-questioning-yor>‘Spy x Family’ Episode 9 saw Twilight questioning Yor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Spy-x-Family-Episode-10-Release-Date-1200x675.jpg><p><a href=#>Spy x Family Episode 9 picks up</a> in the middle of Yuri’s visit, with him demanding that Yor and Loid kiss to prove they’re really married. They almost do, but Yor’s brother changes his mind at the last minute. His belligerent behavior earns him a few slaps from his sister before he departs. And although Loid attempts to keep things cordial — friendly, even — Yuri vows to expose their union as a lie.</p><p>That’s an ominous place to leave things, especially since Loid and Yor are being dishonest. Fortunately, Loid already knows that Yuri is part of the secret police. In “Show Off How in Love You Are,” he embraces his Twilight persona fully, even investigating whether Yor is trying to spy on him as well.</p><p>His efforts turn up nothing unusual, and the Forgers are back to normal by the time the episode ends. It looks like Spy x Family Episode 10 will shift focus back to Anya on its release date. When exactly is that?</p><h2 id=h-when-does-spy-x-family-come-out-episode-10-release-date-and-time>When does ‘Spy x Family’ come out?

The brief preview for the coming episode teases a <a href=#>return to Eden College</a>. It looks like Anya and Damian will find themselves playing a game of dodgeball. And with Operation Strix in the works, even that’s likely to be a big deal.</p><p>It’s hard to say if they’ll be on opposing teams or not, but it looks like things get heated either way. Hopefully, this doesn’t set Twilight’s plans back even further (but if we’re being honest, it probably will).</p><p>With Anya and Damian’s relationship already on shaky ground, this chapter could prove a turning point — for better of for worse. It’s not one fans will want to miss.
